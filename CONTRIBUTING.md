# Contributing to iOS Drawer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to iOS Drawer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Export types that consumers might need
- Use strict mode

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use `forwardRef` for components that need ref forwarding
- Provide proper prop types and default values

### CSS

- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow BEM-like naming conventions
- Ensure styles work across all supported browsers
- Include dark mode support
- Test on iOS Safari specifically

### Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Provide proper ARIA attributes
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Include focus management

### iOS Compatibility

- Test on actual iOS devices when possible
- Handle viewport changes properly
- Account for safe areas
- Prevent unwanted zoom on inputs
- Handle keyboard appearance gracefully

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Include edge cases
- Test accessibility features
- Test iOS-specific behavior when possible
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual components and hooks
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
3. **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation
4. **Visual Tests**: Regression testing for UI changes
5. **Performance Tests**: Animation performance, memory usage

## iOS Testing

### Required Testing

- Test on actual iOS devices (iPhone and iPad)
- Test in iOS Safari, Chrome for iOS, and Firefox for iOS
- Test in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Test with virtual keyboard (on-screen keyboard)
- Test with different safe area configurations
- Test in PWA mode (when added to home screen)

### iOS Versions

- iOS 14+ (primary support)
- iOS 13 (best effort)
- Test across different iOS versions when possible

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include usage examples in comments
- Document complex algorithms or workarounds
- Explain iOS-specific code clearly

### README Updates

- Update installation instructions for breaking changes
- Add new examples for significant features
- Update browser support information
- Include migration guides when necessary

### Examples

- Create examples for new features
- Ensure examples work on mobile devices
- Include both basic and advanced usage
- Test examples on iOS devices

## Performance Guidelines

### Animation Performance

- Use `transform` and `opacity` for animations
- Implement proper hardware acceleration
- Avoid layout thrashing
- Target 60fps on mobile devices
- Test on older devices when possible

### Bundle Size

- Keep bundle size minimal
- Use tree-shaking friendly exports
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Consider code splitting for large features

### Memory Management

- Clean up event listeners
- Properly handle component unmounting
- Avoid memory leaks in animations
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` appropriately
